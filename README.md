## 🛠️ Features and Steps

### 📝 Code Highlights
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handled missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant information.
  - Cleaned tweet text by removing stop words, URLs, mentions, hashtags, and special characters.
  
- **Feature Extraction**:
  - Tokenized text using NLP techniques.
  - Converted text data into numerical features using `TF-IDF` or word embeddings.

- **Sentiment Classification**:
  - Built a sentiment classifier using machine learning models like Logistic Regression or deep learning techniques.
  - Evaluated the model using the validation dataset for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
